What is Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and when should it be initiated?,"Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a practice of skin-to-skin care, which involves keeping the baby's face directly exposed to the mother's skin during the birthing process. This practice aims to promote comfort, support the baby's breathing, and improve breastfeeding. 

It is typically initiated in health-care facilities as soon as the baby is clinically stable. However, it is important to note that the quality of evidence for most of the critical outcomes, including those related to mortality, neonatal infections, and hypothermia, is high.

For instance, the Quality of Evidence (QoE) for mortality and neonatal infections was found to be high. For hyperthermia and re-admission to hospital, the QoE was moderate. Values and preferences for KMC included that it goes beyond just mortality and morbidity, and includes improved breastfeeding practices and bonding between mother and baby.

In conclusion, Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a valuable intervention that promotes comfort and supports the baby's breathing, making it a suitable option for initiating in health-care facilities.","Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is recommended as routine care for all preterm or low-birth-weight infants. It involves early, continuous skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding.

What is the role of humidification in oxygen therapy?,"In oxygen therapy, humidification is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to maintain the humidity in the air around the patient's respiratory system, which is essential for the proper functioning of the lungs and respiratory tract. By adding moisture to the air, it prevents the formation of condensation, which can lead to dryness and irritation of the mucous membranes and the respiratory passages.

Secondly, humidification helps to dilute the oxygen molecules, making them easier to absorb by the blood vessels in the lungs. This reduces the risk of oxygen toxicity, especially for patients with compromised lungs or existing medical conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Thirdly, humidification helps to keep the air moist, which is beneficial for maintaining the cleanliness and safety of the respiratory tract. This includes preventing the growth of bacteria and fungi that could cause infections.

Lastly, humidification allows for better visualization of the patient's breathing patterns and helps to monitor their oxygen saturation levels more accurately, which is important for early detection and intervention in cases of hypoxia.

Therefore, the primary role of humidification in oxygen therapy is to ensure that the patient receives the right amount of moisture and nutrients to maintain their health and well-being.","Humidification is required only when oxygen is delivered via methods that bypass the nose, like nasopharyngeal catheters or with high-flow systems.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'recommendations_child_health_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8098941445350647,0.8333842754364014,0.8214713335037231
