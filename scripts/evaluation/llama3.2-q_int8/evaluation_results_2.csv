What is Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and when should it be initiated?,"According to the context provided, Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a method of skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her baby, where the baby is held against the mother's chest, often with the baby's bare skin against the mother's bare skin. This practice is also referred to as ""continuous skin-to-skin contact"" in the context.

As per the guidelines, KMC should be initiated when the baby is able to breathe on its own (no apnoeic episodes) and is free of life-threatening conditions. It can begin after birth, after initial assessment and where needed basic resuscitation, provided the baby and mother are stable. For low birth weight babies (less than 2000 grams), KMC is recommended to be started immediately. 

For full-term babies, it is recommended to start KMC when the baby is able to breathe on its own and is free of life-threatening conditions.","Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is recommended as routine care for all preterm or low-birth-weight infants. It involves early, continuous skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding.

What if mother's milk for preterm infants is not available? What should be used?,"According to the context, if mother's milk is not available for preterm infants, donor human milk is recommended as a substitute (conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence). It should be used when mother's own milk is not available. Additionally, in some cases, nutrient-enriched preterm formula may be considered as a last resort (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). However, it is emphasized that these alternatives should be used only when mother's own milk is not available, and expressed mother's own milk should be supplemented only when unavoidable.

It's worth noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that mothers should be encouraged and supported to provide their own breast milk for their infants, and that supplementing with donor human milk or formula should only occur when necessary.","hen mother's own milk is unavailable, donor human milk may be considered for feeding preterm or low-birth-weight infants, especially those who are very preterm or very low-birth-weight.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'Milk-Feeding_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8458478450775146,0.8855098485946655,0.8652245402336121
Should multicomponent fortification of breast milk be used  for  preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, multicomponent fortification of breast milk is not routinely recommended for all preterm or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, but it may be considered for very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very LBW (< 1.5 kg) infants who are fed mother's own milk or donor human milk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends considering multicomponent fortification ""for very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very LBW (< 1.5 kg) infants"" as a conditional recommendation, with the caveat that it should be based on clinical judgement and shared decision-making with parents.

Additionally, the guidelines suggest that the type of fortifier used is not well established, and the timing and duration of fortification are not clearly defined. Therefore, further research is needed to inform the use of multicomponent fortification in preterm infants.

 What is the recommendation for starting feeding in preterm infants?,"According to the context, the recommendation for starting feeding in preterm infants is to initiate enteral feeding as soon as possible, which includes direct breastfeeding and feeding by cups, nasogastric tubes, or other methods. It is recommended to give mother's own milk whenever possible, and if not available, donor human milk should be given. For infants who cannot breastfeed, expressed mother's own milk should be used as soon as it becomes available.

Can preterm infants be given preterm formula?,"According to the context provided, yes, preterm infants can be given preterm formula when mother's own milk and donor human milk are not available. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends considering nutrient-enriched preterm formula for very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth-weight infants (less than 1.5 kg). This is stated in Recommendation A.5, which is updated and conditional on shared decision-making with parents, informing them about the benefits and risks, and the need for further research.

It's also mentioned that commercially available nutrient-enriched formulas specifically formulated for preterm infants may be considered for infants born at 32-36 weeks' gestation or with a birth weight of 1.5-2.4 kg. However, the WHO notes that there is limited information on the timing of initiation and duration of preterm formula use, and therefore, this should be based on clinical judgment. 

Additionally, mothers should be encouraged and supported to provide their own breast milk (including colostrum) for their infants if possible.","If mother's own milk and donor human milk are not available, nutrient-enriched preterm formula may be considered for very preterm or very low-birth-weight infants.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8449676036834717,0.9460705518722534,0.892665445804596
Should exclusive breastfeeding be continued for preterm infants?,"Based on the provided context, it seems that the guidelines suggest that exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for preterm infants, and that avoiding bottles and teats may improve exclusive breastfeeding outcomes.

According to the systematic review mentioned in the context, feeding preterm infants using alternative feeding devices, such as cups, spoons, droppers, or finger feeding, instead of bottles and teats, probably improves exclusive breastfeeding at discharge, at 3 months, and at 6 months.

However, I couldn't find specific information about continuing exclusive breastfeeding specifically for preterm infants beyond the initial period. The context mentions that the guidelines recommend providing breast milk using bottles and teats if medically indicated, but it doesn't provide clear guidance on whether exclusive breastfeeding should continue for preterm infants beyond a certain period.

It's worth noting that the context suggests that mothers of preterm infants need extra support, especially for positioning and attachment, and that frequent coaching and support can help build maternal confidence. Therefore, it's likely that the guidelines would recommend continued support and encouragement for breastfeeding, regardless of the infant's prematurity.

To confirm the recommendation for preterm infants, I would like to clarify what specific aspect of exclusive breastfeeding you are referring to (e.g., duration, frequency, type of feeding). Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?","Yes, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for preterm or low-birth-weight infants until six months of age.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['breastfeeding_HNN', 'breast_feeding_HNN', 'breast_feeding_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8130638003349304,0.8866356611251831,0.8482574820518494
Is iron supplementation necessary for preterm infants?,"According to the context, enteral iron supplementation is recommended for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants who are not receiving iron from another source, as stated in Recommendation A.10a. This is supported by moderate-certainty evidence, indicating a strong recommendation. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends iron supplementation for VLBW infants fed mother's own milk or donor human milk, starting at 2 weeks and continuing until 6 months of age, with a daily dose of 2–4 mg/kg per day.",Enteral iron supplementation is recommended for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants who are not receiving iron from other sources.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8581814765930176,0.9556455612182617,0.9042949080467224
Is vitamin D supplementation  necessary for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, vitamin D supplementation is considered a conditional recommendation for preterm or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants who are fed mother's own milk or donor human milk, and is recommended for those with low vitamin D levels.

The context states that ""the GDG noted that the evidence on harms (increased mortality) was uncertain due to low-certainty evidence and imprecision"" and that the recommendation is conditional on shared decision-making with parents, which includes informing parents about the benefits and risks and the need for further research.

In other words, vitamin D supplementation is not universally recommended for all preterm or LBW infants, but rather for those who are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in improving outcomes such as all-cause mortality, morbidity, growth, and neurodevelopment is still uncertain, with varying degrees of certainty across different outcomes.

Therefore, the current recommendation is that vitamin D supplementation should be discussed with parents and considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account individual circumstances and the potential benefits and risks.",Enteral vitamin D supplementation may be considered for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants not receiving it from another source.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8196377158164978,0.8931989669799805,0.8548386693000793
Can zinc be supplemented to preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, yes, zinc supplementation can be considered for preterm or low-birth-weight infants. In fact, the systematic review found a small to moderate benefit of zinc supplementation in reducing all-cause mortality, diarrhoea, and respiratory infections in preterm or low-birth-weight infants (A.10b). Additionally, there is moderate-certainty evidence suggesting an increase in weight, length, and head circumference in zinc-supplemented infants. However, the certainty of the evidence regarding harms, such as decreased mental development scores, is low.",Zinc supplementation may be considered for preterm or low-birth-weight infants if not provided from other sources.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8419564366340637,0.9024567604064941,0.8711574673652649
Are probiotics recommended for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed very preterm infants (< 32 weeks' gestation), but the recommendation is conditional on shared decision-making with parents, and informed about the benefits and risks and the need for further research.

This is stated in the WHO recommendations for care of the preterm or low-birth-weight infant, specifically in section A.11 Probiotics, where it says: ""RECOMMENDATION A.11 (NEW): Probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed very preterm infants (< 32 weeks’ gestation).""","Probiotics may be considered for human milk-fed very preterm infants, as part of preventive care.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8403432369232178,0.9202081561088562,0.8784641623497009
Is emollient therapy beneficial for preterm babies?,"According to the context provided, the answer is No. Recommendation 31 states that ""Routine application of topical emollients in term, healthy newborns for the prevention of skin conditions is not recommended."" Additionally, the summary of evidence and considerations for the use of emollients for the prevention of skin conditions in term, healthy newborns indicates that the evidence is insufficient, and there may be potential risks associated with certain types of emollients.

What is hypoxaemia and why is it dangerous in children?,"According to the context, hypoxaemia refers to ""low levels of oxygen in the blood"" (low blood oxygen saturation or content). In children, hypoxaemia is considered a life-threatening condition that requires early detection and treatment.

As stated in the context, ""Hypoxaemia means low levels of oxygen in the blood (low blood oxygen saturation or content)... Arterial oxygen saturation is referred to as SaO2 when measured by gas analysis and as SpO2 when measured by pulse oximetry... A lower limit (mean minus 2 standard deviations) of 94%"" (section 2.1 Definitions).

In children, hypoxaemia can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not recognized and treated promptly. According to the context, ""Reduced oxygen delivery and failure of cellular use of oxygen occur under various circumstances. If hypoxia is not recognized, it results in organ dysfunction and death."" (section 2.1 Definitions)

Furthermore, the context mentions that hypoxaemia can be caused by various conditions, including acute respiratory tract infection (such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis), upper airway obstruction, severe asthma, common neonatal conditions like birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis, heart failure, cardiac arrest, trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, and obstetric and perioperative emergencies.

Overall, hypoxaemia is indeed a serious condition in children that requires immediate attention and proper treatment to prevent complications and ensure their survival.","Hypoxaemia is a condition where there is a low level of oxygen in the blood. It is life-threatening because it can lead to organ dysfunction and death, especially in children with pneumonia, neonatal conditions, or during surgical emergencies.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8124651312828064,0.8939857482910156,0.8512781858444214
What is the normal SpO_ level in children?,"According to the provided context, the normal SpO2 level in children is not explicitly stated as a specific number. However, it is mentioned that a lower limit (mean minus 2 standard deviations) of 94% is considered as the reference value for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). For pulse oximetry (SpO2), a level of 90% is often used as a threshold for starting oxygen therapy, but it's not explicitly stated as the normal SpO2 level. 

It is mentioned that children living at high altitudes have a lower partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and therefore a lower SpO2 level, and in areas at high altitudes and with limited resources, oxygen may be given at a lower SpO2 level, such as ≤ 87%.","At sea level, normal SpO_ levels range from 97% to 99%. A threshold of <90% is commonly used to initiate oxygen therapy, as lower levels may rapidly progress to critical oxygen deficiency.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8352029323577881,0.8862313628196716,0.8599608540534973
How can health workers detect hypoxaemia?,"According to the context, health workers can detect hypoxaemia through clinical signs, which include:

* Central cyanosis (blue colouring of the tongue or gums)
* Nasal flaring
* Inability to drink or feed (due to respiratory distress)
* Grunting with every breath
* Depressed mental state (i.e. drowsy, lethargic)

Additionally, in some situations, less specific signs may also indicate hypoxaemia, including:

* Severe lower chest wall indrawing
* Respiratory rate ≥ 70/min
* Head nodding

It is also mentioned that pulse oximetry is the most accurate non-invasive method for detecting hypoxaemia, and it should be used whenever possible. Pulse oximetry can detect hypoxaemia in 20-30% more children than clinical signs alone.

(Source: [START_OF_CONTEXT], sections 1.1, 3.1.1, 3.2.1)","Pulse oximetry is the recommended method for detecting hypoxaemia.

What are some clinical signs of hypoxaemia in neonates?,"According to the provided context, in neonates, the signs of hypoxaemia are not specific and may be present at a relatively advanced stage. Some of the clinical signs mentioned include:

* Cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin)
* Grunting with every breath
* Inability to drink or feed (due to respiratory distress)
* Depressed mental state (i.e., drowsy, lethargic)

It is also mentioned that these signs may not be sufficient to diagnose hypoxaemia reliably, especially in neonates, and that pulse oximetry is recommended for managing sick neonates. According to the text, ""No one clinical sign can be used to identify all hypoxaemic neonates."" 

Is there anything else you would like to know about the topic?","Signs include central cyanosis, apnoea, bradycardia, and poor feeding.

What equipment is most suitable to detect hypoxaemia in hospitals?,"According to the context, pulse oximetry is considered the best method available for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia. It measures the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in arterial blood (SpO2) and is a non-invasive method. Additionally, pulse oximeters can be used to detect and monitor hypoxaemia, making more efficient use of oxygen supplies and improving patient monitoring.","Pulse oximeters are the most suitable non-invasive tool for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia, particularly in children with respiratory conditions.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8729922771453857,0.9211927652359009,0.8964450359344482
When should oxygen therapy be started in children?,"According to the context, oxygen therapy should be started in children with emergency signs, including obstructed or absent breathing, severe respiratory distress, central cyanosis, signs of shock, coma or reduced level of consciousness, convulsions, and signs of severe dehydration.

Additionally, children with respiratory disease living at ≤ 2500 m above sea level should receive oxygen therapy if their oxygen saturation is ≤ 90%.

It is also recommended to start oxygen therapy in children with emergency signs, even if they only have respiratory distress, according to the source: ""When the child has only respiratory distress, oxygen supplementation with other ETAT emergency signs with or without respiratory distress should receive oxygen therapy if their SpO2 is < 94%.""

What are the main sources of oxygen in healthcare settings?,"According to the provided context, the main sources of oxygen in healthcare settings are:

1. Cylinders: Oxygen is produced in manufacturing plants by cooling air, separate pure oxygen, which is then passed through a liquid oxygen pump into cylinders.
2. Concentrators: Draw in air from the environment, remove nitrogen, and extract the remaining oxygen, leaving almost pure oxygen. They provide a safe, less expensive, reliable, and efficient source of oxygen, suitable for low-resource settings.
3. Central piped oxygen: Distributed through pipes located outside the building, using liquid oxygen, high-pressure gaseous oxygen cylinders, large oxygen concentrators, or a combination.

These sources were mentioned in section 4.1 ""Sources of oxygen"" of the provided document.","The main sources are oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and central pipeline systems.

According to Recommendation 10, it states ""In newly-born babies requiring positive-pressure ventilation, ventilation should be initiated using a face-mask interface."" It also mentions that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of other interfaces, including head boxes.","No, face masks, head boxes, and tents are not recommended due to high oxygen consumption and risks such as carbon dioxide toxicity.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Newborn_Reference_Manual_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'newborn_resuscitation_HNN']",1,0.5,0.8461312055587769,0.8871016502380371,0.8661321997642517
What is the role of humidification in oxygen therapy?,"According to the context, humidification is recommended for certain situations in oxygen therapy. According to the recommendations, humidification is needed when oxygen is given via a nasopharyngeal catheter and for all patients with an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy. Additionally, humidification is recommended for oxygen therapy at a higher-than-standard flow rate (> 4 L/min) through a nasal catheter or nasal prongs.

It is also mentioned that humidification is not necessary for standard flow oxygen therapy, but effective humidification is necessary for high-flow CPAP in neonates and infants.

It's worth noting that the context suggests that humidification is not required in tropical climates if oxygen is delivered from a concentrator, as concentrators provide oxygen at room temperature, whereas cylinders deliver cold oxygen.

Referring to the text: ""Humidification is needed when oxygen is given via a nasopharyngeal catheter and for all patients with an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy.""","Humidification is required only when oxygen is delivered via methods that bypass the nose, like nasopharyngeal catheters or with high-flow systems.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'recommendations_child_health_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8372058272361755,0.8839490413665771,0.8599426746368408
What complications can arise from improper oxygen delivery?,"According to the provided context, improper oxygen delivery can result in several complications. These include:

* Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - a severe form of abnormal eye development that can lead to blindness
* Lung injury
* Chronic lung disease (also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia) in extremely preterm infants
* Cumulative oxygen exposure leading to lung problems in moderately preterm babies
* Blindness in some premature infants due to low, but unmonited, oxygen exposure
* Direct oxygen toxicity to lung tissue
* Increased risk of injury from high levels of oxygen in the blood, regardless of the administered oxygen concentration
* Low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia), which can be life-threatening

These complications can arise from inadequate regulation of oxygen delivery methods, including:

* 100% oxygen administration
* Unmonitored oxygen saturation during supplemental oxygen administration
* ""Prophylactic"" administration of oxygen to sick or at-risk newborns without clinical indication
* Environmental enrichment with oxygen (e.g., oxygen in incubator)
* Use of non-rebreathing masks or funnels to deliver oxygen
* Interrupted oxygen administration (rotating allocation of available oxygen)

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything.","Complications include nasal bleeding, airway obstruction, gastric distension, and in severe cases, pneumothorax if high flow rates are used inappropriately.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Use_Inpatient_HNN', 'Oxygen_Use_Inpatient_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,0.3333333333333333,0.7905447483062744,0.853011965751648,0.8205912709236145
Why is oxygen therapy often unavailable in developing countries?,"According to the context, oxygen therapy is often unavailable in developing countries due to several reasons, including:

* Supplies are often unreliable: ""Oxygen treatment remains an inaccessible luxury for a large proportion of severely countries.""
* Equipment is poorly maintained, inappropriate, or dimpled in benefits: ""the benefits of treatment may be diminished by poorly maintained, inappropriate equipment""
