What is Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and when should it be initiated?,"According to the provided context, Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a method of skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her baby, where the baby is held against the mother's chest, typically wrapped in a blanket or cloth. This practice is also known as ""continuous kangaroo care"" or ""kangaroo holding"".

As stated in the context, KMC should be initiated when the baby is:

* Able to breathe on its own (no apnoeic episodes);
* Free of life-threatening conditions.

It can also be initiated immediately after birth, after initial assessment and basic resuscitation, provided the baby and mother are clinically stable. For babies weighing 2000g or less at birth, KMC is strongly recommended (based on moderate-quality evidence).

Additionally, KMC can be initiated before birth, in cases where the baby is clinically stable, and the mother is able to hold the baby against her chest.","Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is recommended as routine care for all preterm or low-birth-weight infants. It involves early, continuous skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding. KMC should be started as soon as possible after birth, whether in a health-care facility or at home, and provided for 8-24 hours per day.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['practice_pocket_guide_HNN', 'improve_preterm_birth_HNN', 'improve_preterm_birth_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8369312882423401,0.8733415603637695,0.8547489047050476
Is mother's own milk recommended for preterm infants?,"According to the context, yes, mother's own milk is recommended for feeding preterm or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, including very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' gestation) or very LBW infants (less than 1.5 kg). This is stated in recommendation A.2, which states ""Mother's own milk is recommended for feeding of preterm or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, including very preterm (< 32 weeks’ gestation) or very LBW (< 1.5 kg) infants.""

What if mother's milk for preterm infants is not available? What should be used?,"According to the context, if mother's milk is not available, donor human milk can be used for preterm infants, including very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth-weight (< 1.5 kg) infants. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that multicomponent fortification of human milk should not be routinely recommended for all preterm or low-birth-weight infants, but may be considered for very preterm infants when mother's own milk or donor human milk is not available.

Additionally, when mother's own milk and donor human milk are not available, nutrient-enriched preterm formula may be considered for very preterm or very low-birth-weight infants. It is also emphasized that if mother's own milk is ever possible, it should be used instead of any other type of milk.

It is worth noting that the WHO does not recommend using artificial formula milk as the primary source of nutrition for preterm infants, as it may not provide the same level of nutritional benefits as human milk.","hen mother's own milk is unavailable, donor human milk may be considered for feeding preterm or low-birth-weight infants, especially those who are very preterm or very low-birth-weight.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'Milk-Feeding_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8644639253616333,0.925904393196106,0.8941299319267273
Should multicomponent fortification of breast milk be used  for  preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that multicomponent fortification of breast milk is not routinely recommended for all preterm or low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, but may be considered for very preterm infants (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very LBW infants who are fed mother's own milk or donor human milk.

This recommendation is conditional on shared decision-making with parents, and the WHO notes that the benefits of multicomponent fortification include increasing weight, length, and head circumference in very preterm or very LBW infants. However, the potential harms, such as mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis, are uncertain.

Therefore, the WHO suggests that multicomponent fortification should be initiated and continued based on clinical judgment, and that mothers and families should be informed about the benefits and risks and the need for further research.

 What is the recommendation for starting feeding in preterm infants?,"According to the context, the strong recommendation is that preterm and low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, including very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) and very LBW (< 1.5 kg) infants, should be fed as early as possible from the first day after birth. Infants who are able to breastfeed should be put to the breast as soon as possible after birth. Infants who are unable to breastfeed should be given expressed mother's own milk as soon as it becomes available. If mother's own milk is not available, donor human milk should be given wherever possible.

Can preterm infants be given preterm formula?,"According to the provided context, yes, preterm infants can be given preterm formula when mother's own milk and donor human milk are not available. However, the recommendation is conditional, meaning it depends on shared decision-making with parents, and they should be informed about the benefits and risks, as well as the need for further research.

This is stated in Recommendation A.5, which says: ""When mother’s own milk and donor human milk are not available, nutrient-enriched preterm formula may be considered for very preterm (< 32 weeks’ gestation) or very low-birth-weight infants."" 

It's also mentioned that the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests considering commercially available nutrient-enriched formulas specifically formulated for preterm infants for infants born at 32–36 weeks' gestation or with birth weight of 1.5–2.4 kg, depending on clinical judgment.","If mother's own milk and donor human milk are not available, nutrient-enriched preterm formula may be considered for very preterm or very low-birth-weight infants.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8513790369033813,0.9394746422767639,0.8932600021362305
Should exclusive breastfeeding be continued for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, it appears that the guidelines recommend continuing exclusive breastfeeding for preterm infants. In fact, the systematic review on the use of cup feeding instead of bottle feeding among preterm infants identified that feeding preterm infants using alternative feeding devices (such as cups, spoons, droppers, or finger feeding) rather than bottles and teats probably improves exclusive breastfeeding at discharge, at 3 months, and at 6 months.

However, the exact duration of exclusive breastfeeding for preterm infants is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Nevertheless, the guidelines emphasize the importance of ongoing support and encouragement to help mothers establish and maintain breastfeeding, regardless of the infant's gestational age.

It's worth noting that the guidelines also mention that mothers of preterm infants have health problems of their own and need motivation and extra support for milk expression. Therefore, it's likely that the recommendation for continued exclusive breastfeeding for preterm infants is intended to take into account the unique challenges they face. 

Would you like more information about the specific duration of exclusive breastfeeding for preterm infants?","Yes, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for preterm or low-birth-weight infants until six months of age.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['breastfeeding_HNN', 'breast_feeding_HNN', 'breast_feeding_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8268272876739502,0.8846824765205383,0.8547770380973816
Is iron supplementation necessary for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, enteral iron supplementation is recommended for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants who are not receiving iron from another source. This is stated in Recommendation A.10a, which is updated and indicates a strong recommendation for iron supplementation. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends iron supplementation for VLBW infants fed mother’s own milk or donor human milk, starting at 2 weeks and continuing until 6 months of age.

The context mentions that the effectiveness evidence was derived from a systematic review of eight trials, reporting on a total of 1093 infants from seven countries, and most trials showed a beneficial effect of iron supplementation on haematological outcomes, such as decreased anaemia, increased weight, and length. However, the evidence on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes is insufficient.

Therefore, the answer to your question is that iron supplementation is indeed necessary for preterm infants, particularly those who are not receiving iron from another source, and is supported by moderate-certainty evidence.",Enteral iron supplementation is recommended for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants who are not receiving iron from other sources.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8368327021598816,0.9371917843818665,0.8841735124588013
Is vitamin D supplementation  necessary for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, the effectiveness evidence was derived from a systematic review of three RCTs totaling 2479 preterm or LBW infants from two countries (India and the USA). The review suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for preterm or LBW infants.

However, the review states that the evidence on harms (increased mortality) is uncertain due to low-certainty evidence and imprecision. Additionally, the review notes that the evidence on effects of vitamin D supplementation on various outcomes such as growth, neurodevelopment, and hospitalization is either very low-certainty or low-certainty.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vitamin D supplementation for preterm or LBW infants if they are at high risk of deficiency, which includes babies born to darker-skinned mothers, especially those born in higher latitudes and in the winter months. However, the review does not provide sufficient evidence to make a definitive conclusion on the necessity of vitamin D supplementation for all preterm infants.

It seems that the recommendation for vitamin D supplementation is conditional, and it should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering individual factors, such as the risk of deficiency, and with informed shared decision-making with parents.",Enteral vitamin D supplementation may be considered for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants not receiving it from another source.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8113726377487183,0.8570759296417236,0.8335983753204346
Can zinc be supplemented to preterm infants?,"According to the context, yes, zinc supplementation can be considered for preterm infants. In fact, the WHO recommends enteral vitamin D supplementation for human milk-fed preterm or low-birth-weight infants, which implies that zinc supplementation might also be beneficial for these infants. However, the evidence on harms (such as increased mortality) is uncertain due to low-certainty evidence and imprecision. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, with informed shared decision-making between parents and healthcare providers.",Zinc supplementation may be considered for preterm or low-birth-weight infants if not provided from other sources.,low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8467342853546143,0.9037021398544312,0.8742912411689758
Are probiotics recommended for preterm infants?,"According to the provided context, probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed very preterm infants less than 32 weeks' gestation. However, the recommendation is conditional on shared decision-making with parents, which includes informing them about the benefits and risks and the need for further research.

As stated in the context, ""RECOMMENDATION A.11 (NEW): Probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed very preterm infants (< 32 weeks’ gestation)"". 

It's also mentioned that the World Health Organization (WHO) did not make a recommendation for infants born after 32 weeks' gestation due to insufficient data. Additionally, the WHO did not make a recommendation on type, formulation, dose, timing, or duration of probiotic administration as there was insufficient evidence. Therefore, the type, formulation, dose, timing, and duration should be based on clinical judgement.","Probiotics may be considered for human milk-fed very preterm infants, as part of preventive care.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8222811222076416,0.9085092544555664,0.8632472157478333
Is emollient therapy beneficial for preterm babies?,"According to the context provided, Routine application of topical emollients in term, healthy newborns for the prevention of skin conditions is NOT RECOMMENDED (Recommendation 31). The guideline development group agreed that there was insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of routine application of topical emollients in term, healthy newborns for either preventing skin conditions or atopic sensitization to allergens.

However, the guideline does mention that the lack of evidence on key neonatal outcomes does not necessarily mean that emollient use is harmless. Additionally, the guideline raises concerns about the potential risk of harm with certain types of emollients from pilot randomized controlled trials and observational studies in term newborns and adults, and in studies of preterm newborns and animals.

Therefore, it seems that the current evidence does not support the routine use of emollients in preterm babies, but further research is needed to fully understand the effects of emollients on preterm infants.","Yes, the application of topical oil (emollients) may be considered for preterm or low-birth-weight infants.",low-birth-weight-infant_HNN,"['maternal_and_newborn_care_HNN', 'maternal_and_newborn_care_HNN', 'low-birth-weight-infant_HNN']",1,0.3333333333333333,0.8298248052597046,0.8860863447189331,0.8570331931114197
How should feeding volume be increased for preterm babies?,"According to the provided context, for preterm babies, especially those weighing under 1.5 kg, feed volumes can be increased by up to 30 ml/kg per day, conditional on careful monitoring for feed intolerance. This recommendation is based on moderate-certainty evidence.

It's also mentioned that the threshold for fast feed advancement is generally considered to be 30 ml/kg per day, which is also consistent with many national guidelines. However, the context notes that the optimal increase in feeding volume may vary depending on individual circumstances, such as the type of milk being fed (human milk or formula).

For example, the context states that the World Health Organization (WHO) previously recommended that feeds could be advanced by up to 30 ml/kg per day with careful monitoring for feed intolerance in infants weighing under 1.5 kg, but notes that further research is needed to understand the neurodevelopmental effects of fast feed advancement.

What is hypoxaemia and why is it dangerous in children?,"According to the context, hypoxaemia refers to ""low levels of oxygen in the blood"" or ""low blood oxygen saturation"", which can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, resulting in organ dysfunction and potentially death.

In children, hypoxaemia is particularly dangerous because it can be caused by various conditions, including pneumonia, acute respiratory tract infections, and other serious illnesses. As stated in the context, ""if hypoxia is not recognized, it results in organ dysfunction and death."" (Section 2.1, Definitions)

Additionally, children living at high altitude are more susceptible to severe hypoxaemia due to lower oxygen levels in the air, and in some cases, severe pneumonia can progress rapidly to severe hypoxaemia, requiring oxygen therapy. (Section 2.3.1 Acute respiratory infections)

It's also worth noting that hypoxaemia can be a complication of other conditions, such as asthma, meningitis, sepsis, heart failure, cardiac arrest, trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, and obstetric and perioperative emergencies. (Section 2.3.2 Other conditions)","Hypoxaemia is a condition where there is a low level of oxygen in the blood. It is life-threatening because it can lead to organ dysfunction and death, especially in children with pneumonia, neonatal conditions, or during surgical emergencies.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8367615938186646,0.9050807356834412,0.869581401348114
What is the normal SpO_ level in children?,"According to the context, in children, the normal SpO2 level is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that a lower limit of 94% (mean minus 2 standard deviations) is considered normal. However, it is also mentioned that at high altitudes, the normal SpO2 level is lower. For children living at altitudes > 2500m, a lower level of saturation, such as SpO2 ≤ 87%, could be used as a threshold for giving oxygen. 

It's also mentioned that in infants aged < 2 months, signs of severe respiratory distress (tachypnoea, severe chest indrawing, head nodding or grunting) should always be given oxygen, and oxygen should always be given continuously until normal saturation is maintained without oxygen.

In general, the context suggests that the normal SpO2 level can vary depending on factors such as altitude, age, and individual patient characteristics.","At sea level, normal SpO_ levels range from 97% to 99%. A threshold of <90% is commonly used to initiate oxygen therapy, as lower levels may rapidly progress to critical oxygen deficiency.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8267714381217957,0.8749659657478333,0.850186288356781
How can health workers detect hypoxaemia?,"According to the context, health workers can detect hypoxaemia through clinical signs, which include:

* Central cyanosis (blue colouring of the tongue or gums)
* Nasal flaring
* Inability to drink or feed (due to respiratory distress)
* Grunting with every breath
* Depressed mental state (i.e. drowsy, lethargic)

However, even with these clinical signs, the accuracy of detection may vary, and pulse oximetry is considered the most accurate non-invasive method for detecting hypoxaemia. Additionally, pulse oximetry can also be used to monitor oxygen levels and guide administration of oxygen therapy.

It is also mentioned that in emergency situations, health workers can identify patients who require oxygen using the ""3TPR MOB"" mnemonic, which stands for:

* SpO2 < 90%
* Central cyanosis
* Nasal flaring
* Inability to drink or feed (due to respiratory distress)
* Grunting with every breath
* Depressed mental state (i.e. drowsy, lethargic)

Source: [START_OF_CONTEXT], DETECTING HYPOXAEMIA, page [insert page number].","Pulse oximetry is the recommended method for detecting hypoxaemia. If not available, clinical signs such as central cyanosis, nasal flaring, grunting, and inability to feed may be used as indicators.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8044304847717285,0.8915562033653259,0.845755398273468
What are some clinical signs of hypoxaemia in neonates?,"According to the context, in neonates, no single clinical sign can be used to identify all hypoxaemic babies. However, some clinical signs that may suggest hypoxaemia in neonates include: 

1. Central cyanosis - Oxygenated haemoglobin is red, while deoxygenated haemoglobin is blue, resulting in blue discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. 
2. Grunting with every breath. 
3. Depressed mental state, i.e., drowsy, lethargic. 
4. Severe lower chest wall indrawing. 
5. Respiratory rate of ≥ 60 per minute (although in the text it is mentioned that respiratory rate ≥ 70/min is a general indicator for children, for neonates it is 60 per minute).

It's worth noting that these signs may not be present in all hypoxic neonates, and pulse oximetry is considered a more accurate method for detecting hypoxaemia in neonates. According to the text, ""Several studies have shown that, in neonates, fast breathing is both insensitive (i.e., many children with fast breathing are not hypoxaemic) for detecting hypoxaemia.""","Signs include central cyanosis, apnoea, bradycardia, and poor feeding. However, these are not always specific, so pulse oximetry is strongly recommended.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.7989861369132996,0.8599779605865479,0.8283608555793762
What equipment is most suitable to detect hypoxaemia in hospitals?,"According to the context, pulse oximetry is considered the best method available for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia. It is a non-invasive method that measures the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in arterial blood (SpO2) and is widely used to detect hypoxaemia in children. 

It is mentioned in the context that ""Pulse oximetry is the most accurate non-invasive method for detecting hypoxaemia"" and that ""When used correctly, pulse oximetry ensures the most efficient use of an expensive resource.""","Pulse oximeters are the most suitable non-invasive tool for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia, particularly in children with respiratory conditions.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.862205445766449,0.9159351587295532,0.8882585763931274
When should oxygen therapy be started in children?,"According to the provided context, oxygen therapy should be started in children with certain conditions. According to recommendation 4, ""Children with emergency signs (obstructed or absent breathing, severe respiratory distress, central cyanosis, signs of shock, coma or reduced level of consciousness, convulsions, or signs of severe dehydration) should receive oxygen therapy during the resuscitation phase if their SpO2 is < 94%."" 

Additionally, according to recommendation 3, in children living at high altitude (> 2500 m above sea level), a lower level of saturation, such as SpO2 ≤ 87%, could be used as a threshold for giving oxygen.

It's also mentioned that children with emergency signs (such as obstructed or absent breathing, severe respiratory distress, central cyanosis, etc.) should receive oxygen therapy even if their SpO2 is not below 94%, as long as they have other emergency signs.","Oxygen should be given when SpO_ falls below 90%, or when clinical signs like central cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, or grunting are observed.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'recommendations_child_health_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8334420919418335,0.8861007690429688,0.8589651584625244
What are the main sources of oxygen in healthcare settings?,"According to the provided context, the main sources of oxygen in healthcare settings are:

What is the preferred method to deliver oxygen in infants?,"According to the context, the preferred method to deliver oxygen to young infants is using nasal prongs. It is mentioned that ""Nasal prongs are the best method for delivering oxygen to young infants and children with severe croup or pertussis."" Additionally, it is stated that ""Humidification is not required with nasal prongs"" and that the inspired oxygen concentration should be between 30–35% in young infants.","Nasal prongs are the preferred method due to their safety, efficiency, and low risk of complications.

Are face masks and head boxes recommended for children?,"Based on the provided context, it appears that face masks are recommended for children, but head boxes are not recommended due to concerns about carbon dioxide retention and interference with feeding. According to Recommendation 10, ""In newly-born babies requiring positive-pressure ventilation, ventilation should be initiated using a face-mask interface."" Additionally, Table 2 suggests that nasal prongs and nasal cannulas are the most efficient means of delivering oxygen to neonates, infants, and children, making face masks a preferred option.","No, face masks, head boxes, and tents are not recommended due to high oxygen consumption and risks such as carbon dioxide toxicity.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Newborn_Reference_Manual_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'newborn_resuscitation_HNN']",1,0.5,0.8491479158401489,0.9073405265808105,0.8772802948951721
What is the role of humidification in oxygen therapy?,"According to the provided context, humidification plays a crucial role in oxygen therapy, especially when oxygen is delivered through a nasopharyngeal catheter or for patients with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. However, for standard flow rates (0.5–1 L/min for neonates, 1–2 L/min for infants, and 1–4 L/min for older children) delivered through nasal catheters or nasal prongs, humidification is not necessary.

On the other hand, when oxygen is delivered at a higher-than-standard flow rate (> 4 L/min) through a nasal catheter or nasal prongs, humidification is necessary. Additionally, unheated bubble humidifiers can be used when oxygen is delivered by cylinders through a nasal catheter, especially when a nasopharyngeal catheter is used or if a higher-than-standard flow rate is used.

It's worth noting that heated humidifiers are more effective than unheated ones and are recommended for providing basic oxygen therapy at standard flow rates or at higher flow rates when a heated humidifier is not available. However, unheated bubble humidifiers can be used in certain situations, such as when oxygen is delivered by cylinders through a nasal catheter, if a nasopharyngeal catheter is used or if a higher-than-standard flow rate is used.

Overall, the need for humidification depends on the specific oxygen delivery method and flow rate.","Humidification is required only when oxygen is delivered via methods that bypass the nose, like nasopharyngeal catheters or with high-flow systems.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'recommendations_child_health_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8166870474815369,0.8784157037734985,0.8464274406433105
What complications can arise from improper oxygen delivery?,"According to the provided context, improper oxygen delivery can lead to several complications in newborns, including:

* Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a severe form of abnormal eye development that can result in blindness
* Lung injury
* Chronic lung disease (also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia), a serious consequence in extremely preterm infants
* Cumulative oxygen exposure leading to lung problems in moderately preterm babies
* Blindness in some survivors of premature infants due to low, but unmonitored, oxygen exposure

These complications can arise from inadequate regulation of oxygen use, including:

* 100% oxygen administration
* Unmonitored oxygen saturation during supplemental oxygen administration
* ""Prophylactic"" administration of oxygen to sick or at-risk newborns without clinical indication
* Environmental enrichment with oxygen (e.g., oxygen in incubator)

* Supplies are often unreliable, making oxygen treatment an ""accessible luxury"" for many patients.
* Poorly maintained, inappropriate equipment can diminish the benefits of treatment.
* Poorly trained staff may not know how to properly use oxygen therapy.
* Inadequate guidelines for oxygen therapy are lacking.

These factors contribute to the unavailability of oxygen therapy in many developing countries, particularly in small district hospitals.","Challenges include unreliable supply chains, lack of trained staff, poorly maintained equipment, and inadequate hospital infrastructure.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN']",1,1.0,0.8441301584243774,0.9009808897972107,0.871629536151886
Should oxygen therapy be used for all children with respiratory distress?,"According to the context, no, oxygen therapy should not be used with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in term and preterm infants with moderate respiratory distress. Instead, they should receive 100% oxygen. However, in term infants with moderate respiratory distress, oxygen therapy should be guided by pulse oximetry, and the oxygen saturation target should be ≥ 92%. 

It's mentioned in Table 1 that ""Moderate respiratory distress: Term and preterm-acute - 100% oxygen should never be used with CPAP."" (Source: [END_OF_CONTEXT])","Not always. While oxygen is vital for hypoxaemic children, unnecessary use should be avoided.

* Prevention of excessive oxygen concentrations
* Hygiene, infection prevention, and thermal protection when delivering oxygen
* Airway suctioning
* Monitoring frequency and adherence to target saturation ranges
* Documentation and use of data to review process and outcome measures
* Awareness of complications

Additionally, facility-specific standard operating policies and procedures, as well as the ability to maintain oxygen delivery systems, are also crucial for safe implementation.

It is also mentioned that biomedical engineers should oversee the systems used to deliver and monitor a continuous supply of oxygen, and that they should be responsible for scheduling calibration, cleaning, electrical safety checks, and repair/replacement of durable and consumable elements, such as probes and bacterial filters.

Overall, a comprehensive training program that covers these essential areas is necessary to ensure safe implementation of oxygen therapy in newborns.","Health workers should be trained to recognize signs of hypoxaemia, use and maintain pulse oximeters and concentrators, and correctly deliver oxygen using appropriate devices.",Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN,"['Oxygen_Use_Inpatient_HNN', 'Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN', 'Oxygen_Use_Inpatient_HNN']",1,0.5,0.8267552256584167,0.8720570802688599,0.8488021492958069
What are birth defects and why are they a global concern?,"According to the context provided, birth defects are defined as ""abnormalities of body structure or function that are present at birth and are of prenatal origin"" (1). They are synonymous with terms like ""birth defects"" or ""congenital abnormalities"", which have a more specific meaning.

Birth defects are a global concern because they result in a significant number of deaths and disabilities worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 270,000 deaths globally were attributable to congenital anomalies during the first 28 days of life in 2010 (2). Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most serious and common of these anomalies.

The context highlights the importance of surveillance programs to monitor and track the burden of congenital anomalies, as they enable countries to better understand the scope of the issue, identify high-risk populations, and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

It is worth noting that the manual emphasizes the need for ongoing surveillance to prevent adverse health conditions and their complications, and to guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs to minimize complications and adverse outcomes among those affected by congenital anomalies.","Birth defects are structural or functional abnormalities that occur during intrauterine life. They are a significant global concern because they cause long-term disability, infant mortality, and have a profound impact on individuals, families, and healthcare systems",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8296098113059998,0.8904526233673096,0.8589550852775574

However, the exact number of children affected by birth defects per year is not explicitly stated. 

However, it is also mentioned that ""In an effort to decrease the number of congenital anomalies worldwide, the WHO encourages countries to build in-country capacity related to the prevention of congenital anomalies..."" Therefore, we can infer that the exact number may vary, but the goal is to reduce the incidence of congenital anomalies.","It is estimated that more than 8 million children are born annually with a serious birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin, most of whom are in low- and middle-income countries.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['care_small_newborns_who', 'Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8501777648925781,0.8908315300941467,0.8700300455093384
Can birth defects be prevented?,"According to the context provided, adequate periconceptional use of folic acid (as a supplement or through fortification) can prevent most cases of spina bifida, which is a type of congenital anomaly. Additionally, preventing certain non-genetic risk factors, such as pregestational diabetes, obesity, seizure medications, hyperthermia, and folic acid insufficiency/deficiency, may also contribute to reducing the occurrence of congenital anomalies.","Yes, many birth defects can be prevented through cost-effective interventions such as vaccination, adequate nutrition, fortification of foods with folic acid and iodine, and appropriate prenatal care.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8437294960021973,0.8893543481826782,0.8659413456916809
What are the key strategies for preventing birth defects?,"According to the context, it appears that the key strategies for preventing birth defects involve monitoring and surveillance, as mentioned in the document ""BIRTH DEFECTS SURVEILLANCE: A MANUAL FOR PROGRAMME MANAGERS (SECOND EDITION)"". Specifically, the SMART framework is discussed, which stands for:

* Specific: targeting a specific outcome, indicator, or area for improvement
* Measurable: quantifying the indicator(s)
* Achievable: stating what results can realistically be achieved with available resources
* Time-related: specifying when the result(s) can be achieved.

Additionally, the context mentions that programs can focus on conducting surveillance on clinically important birth defects with known modifiable risk factors, such as Neural Tube Defects (NTDs).

It also suggests that having achievable and realistic goals is crucial, and that programs should prioritize collecting data on variables that are relevant to the specific goals of the program. Furthermore, having trained staff with the necessary epidemiologic and clinical capacity to identify, describe, code, and classify relatively rare and complex conditions is essential.

However, I couldn't find any direct information on specific prevention strategies in the provided context.

What interventions help eliminate congenital syphilis?,"According to the context, the interventions that help eliminate congenital syphilis include:

* Screening pregnant women for syphilis and treating those who are seropositive
* Providing injectable antibiotics to newborns who are symptomatic or at high risk for congenital syphilis
* Ensuring that mothers who are seropositive are treated with penicillin according to the dosage appropriate for the stage of syphilis
* Implementing simple and effective solutions such as hygienic childbirth practices and clean cord care practices
* Administering maternal tetanus vaccine immunization to pregnant women, ideally at least 2 doses prior to childbirth, with the second dose given at least 4 weeks apart and the second dose given at least 2 weeks before childbirth

These interventions aim to reduce the risk of congenital syphilis and its complications, such as stillbirth, neonatal deaths, preterm birth, low birth weight, and infected infants (References: Recommendations on newborn health. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017, Guidelines for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2016).

How can rubella infection during pregnancy affect the baby?,"According to the context, rubella infection during pregnancy can result in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by congenital heart disease, cataracts, hearing impairment, and developmental delays. Additionally, CRS can also cause single or combined defects such as microcephaly, microphthalmia, meningoencephalitis, mental retardation, purpura, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone disease. 

It's mentioned that fetuses infected with rubella early in pregnancy are at greatest risk of intrauterine death, spontaneous abortion, and congenital malformations. The risk of congenital malformations due to rubella decreases after the twelfth week of gestation, and defects are rare after the twentieth week of gestation.","Rubella infection in early pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leading to deafness, blindness, heart defects, and developmental delays in infants.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Standards_Maternal_Neonatal_care_HNN', 'Standards_Maternal_Neonatal_care_HNN', 'Infection_Prevention_NICU_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8402888774871826,0.9272804260253906,0.8816440105438232
What is recommended to prevent congenital rubella syndrome?,"According to the provided context, vaccination against rubella is considered the most effective method of preventing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all children aged 12 months or older, schoolgirls, and women of childbearing age should be vaccinated against rubella, according to national policy and guidelines. Additionally, pregnant women should be informed about the importance of avoiding contact with individuals with rubella and should be advised to avoid pregnancy for one month after rubella vaccination. 

It is also mentioned that in countries where the rubella vaccine has been introduced into the national immunization schedule, health providers of maternal and neonatal services must ensure that pregnant women receive the vaccine and that the vaccine is properly stored and administered. Furthermore, surveillance is conducted for rubella in all age groups and for congenital rubella syndrome, and investigation of cases of suspected rubella in pregnancy and exposure to rubella during pregnancy is given priority.",Vaccination with the rubella-containing vaccine before pregnancy is the most effective method for preventing congenital rubella syndrome.,Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Infection_Prevention_NICU_HNN', 'Standards_Maternal_Neonatal_care_HNN', 'Standards_Maternal_Neonatal_care_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8420273065567017,0.9184713959693909,0.8785896897315979
How does food fortification help prevent birth defects?,"According to the provided context, there is no mention of food fortification helping to prevent birth defects. However, there is a mention of fortification being provided until a prespecified body weight was attained (most commonly, 1.8–2.0 kg), or until a prespecified postmenstrual age (most commonly 34–36 weeks) or until discharge from hospital. Additionally, the context mentions that there is ""no trials gave infants additional carbohydrate or protein in the control arm"" and ""No trials gave infants additional carbohydrate or protein in the control arm"". 

It appears that the context is discussing the effects of multicomponent fortification in relation to infant growth and development, rather than its role in preventing birth defects. If you're looking for information on how to prevent birth defects, I'd like to clarify that the context doesn't seem to address this specific topic. Would you like me to try and find relevant information or clarify anything else?",Fortifying foods with micronutrients such as folic acid and iodine significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects and cognitive impairments caused by iodine deficiency.,Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['low-birth-weight-infant_HNN', 'commodities_HNN', 'Maternal_child_nutrition']",0,0.0,0.7915128469467163,0.8315140604972839,0.81102055311203

What role does antenatal care play in preventing birth defects?,"According to the provided context, antenatal care plays a crucial role in preventing birth defects. Chart 1.1 in the ""Care of the Newborn Reference Manual"" lists ""Neonatal tetanus"" as a newborn problem that may be prevented through antenatal care. Additionally, the context mentions that antenatal care helps prevent problems like low birth weight and newborn infections, which can contribute to various birth defects.

Furthermore, antenatal care includes measures such as:

* Maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid
* Screening and treatment for syphilis
* Screening and treatment for other sexually transmitted infections
* Malaria prevention through intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
* Screening and treatment for anemia and hookworm
* Micronutrient supplementation (vitamin A, iron, folate, iodine)

These interventions aim to address potential risks that can lead to birth defects, making antenatal care an essential component of preventing birth defects.","Antenatal care allows for early screening and management of maternal conditions and infections, nutritional counseling, and preventive measures like vaccinations and supplementation, all of which help prevent birth defects.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Newborn_Reference_Manual_HNN', 'Newborn_Reference_Manual_HNN', 'midwife_community_who']",0,0.0,0.8297281265258789,0.8900344967842102,0.8588239550590515
Are genetic factors a major cause of birth defects?,"According to the provided context, approximately one quarter of all congenital anomalies may have a genetic cause, which is around 25%. However, more recent estimates suggest that this proportion could be higher, as advances in cytogenetics and genetic testing have led to the identification of previously undetected chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations, and genetic polymorphisms.

Single-gene defects are considered to be the most common genetic cause of congenital anomalies, while chromosomal abnormalities are also significant contributors. Specifically, about 10% of children with congenital anomalies have chromosomal changes, which can include numerical abnormalities, such as trisomies, monosomies, or deletions, as well as duplications.

It's worth noting that single-gene defects are often associated with multiple congenital anomalies that are part of syndromic conditions, whereas isolated malformations are less likely to be caused by single-gene mutations.","Yes, many birth defects have genetic or partially genetic origins. While some are inherited, others result from mutations or environmental exposures during pregnancy.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN']",0,0.0,0.8248347043991089,0.874575138092041,0.8489770293235779
Why are birth defects more common in low-income countries?,"According to the provided context, it is mentioned that ""Congenital abnormalities contribute to 6% of deaths of children under 5 years of age globally, of which 92% occur in low- and middle-income countries."" This implies that birth defects are indeed more common in low-income countries. However, the context does not explicitly state why this is the case.

It can be inferred that various factors such as limited access to prenatal care, inadequate nutrition, poor sanitation, and increased exposure to environmental toxins may contribute to the higher incidence of birth defects in low-income countries. Nevertheless, without further information, I couldn't provide a more detailed explanation."," In low- and middle-income countries, limited access to prenatal care, poor maternal nutrition, inadequate vaccination coverage, and lack of awareness contribute to a higher prevalence of birth defects.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Birth_defects_HNN', 'Birth_defects_HNN', 'care_small_newborns_who']",0,0.0,0.8653812408447266,0.9317312836647034,0.8973314762115479
Can fortifying flour with folic acid reduce neural tube defects?,"According to the provided context, it seems that fortifying flour with folic acid does not specifically address the reduction of neural tube defects. However, the context mentions that a study was conducted in India on the efficacy of periconceptional folic acid containing vitamin supplementation in prevention of open neural tube defects, but it doesn't mention anything about fortifying flour with folic acid. 

It is worth noting that the context does mention that two trials comparing folate alone vs. vitamins alone showed that reduction in NTD (neural tube defects) is due to folate and not to vitamins.","Yes, fortifying flour with folic acid is a proven public health intervention that significantly lowers the incidence of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.",Prevent_birth_defects_HNN,"['Standards_Maternal_Neonatal_care_HNN', 'commodities_HNN', 'Maternal_child_nutrition']",0,0.0,0.8473132848739624,0.8826159834861755,0.8646044731140137
