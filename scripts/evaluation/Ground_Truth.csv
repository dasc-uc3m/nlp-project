What are some clinical signs of hypoxaemia in neonates?;Signs include central cyanosis, apnoea, bradycardia, and poor feeding. However, these are not always specific, so pulse oximetry is strongly recommended.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What equipment is most suitable to detect hypoxaemia in hospitals?;Pulse oximeters are the most suitable non-invasive tool for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia, particularly in children with respiratory conditions.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
When should oxygen therapy be started in children?;Oxygen should be given when SpO_ falls below 90%, or when clinical signs like central cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, or grunting are observed.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What are the main sources of oxygen in healthcare settings?;The main sources are oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and central pipeline systems. Concentrators are especially suitable for low-resource settings due to their reliability and cost-effectiveness.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What is the preferred method to deliver oxygen in infants?;Nasal prongs are the preferred method due to their safety, efficiency, and low risk of complications. Standard flow rates vary by age and weight.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
Are face masks and head boxes recommended for children?;No, face masks, head boxes, and tents are not recommended due to high oxygen consumption and risks such as carbon dioxide toxicity.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What is the role of humidification in oxygen therapy?;Humidification is required only when oxygen is delivered via methods that bypass the nose, like nasopharyngeal catheters or with high-flow systems.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What complications can arise from improper oxygen delivery?;Complications include nasal bleeding, airway obstruction, gastric distension, and in severe cases, pneumothorax if high flow rates are used inappropriately.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
Why is oxygen therapy often unavailable in developing countries?;Challenges include unreliable supply chains, lack of trained staff, poorly maintained equipment, and inadequate hospital infrastructure.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
Should oxygen therapy be used for all children with respiratory distress?;Not always. While oxygen is vital for hypoxaemic children, unnecessary use should be avoided. Pulse oximetry should guide decisions when possible.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
How should oxygen be administered in severely ill neonates?;Nasal prongs or catheters at low flow rates are preferred. Oxygen saturation should be maintained at or above 88%, but not exceeding 95% in preterm infants to avoid complications.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
What training is required to implement oxygen therapy safely?;Health workers should be trained to recognize signs of hypoxaemia, use and maintain pulse oximeters and concentrators, and correctly deliver oxygen using appropriate devices.;Oxygen_Therapy_child_HNN;
